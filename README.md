This is my final year project. 

MedicareAI is a multiclass classification system enhanced using DCGAN, WGAN and WGANGP. 
Three classifiers, EfficientNet, ResNet50 and InceptionNet/GoogLeNet, are trained on following cases:
  1. Imbalanced data
  2. Data with traditional augmentation
  3. Data with DCGAN based augmentation
  4. Data with WGAN based augmentation
  5. Data with WGANGP based augmentation
  
 Each model trained on above cases is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, FPR, FNR, TNR and AUC score along with ROC curve.
 Finally, a web application is developed by interegrating the best performing model.
 
 Following tools and technologies are used in this project.
 
  1. Python
  2. NumPy
  3. Matplotlib
  4. Seaborn
  5. Scikit-Learn
  6. PyTorch
  7. MYSQL
  8. Django
  9. HTML
  10. CSS
  11. JavaScript
  12. Jupyter Notebook
  13. VS Code
